# NotifHide
A jailbreak tweak that hides specific notifications from appearing in NC.

As I plan on uploading this tweak to the Cydia app store and I don't have a lot of experience, I hope people will look at this and suggest improvements. I don't want it to be an internally aweful tweak.

Right now it's only in english, I wanted to keep it simple. I'll work with some language stuff later on.
